<h2>What is the Generator?</h2>

<p>
    Simply put the generator is a scaffolding tool built to help you easily create richmedia units. This richmedia generator
    was built with the use of Yeoman. Yeoman is web scaffolding tool for modern webtools. If you would like to know more
    about Yoeman you can head over to their site <a href="https://yeoman.io/">here</a>.

<h2>Richmedia Temple Server</h2>

<p>
    So now that you know what the generator is, let's explain what the Temple Server is. The Temple server is the second
    tool that you will use in your display advertising tool box. The richmedia temple server (RTS) is a build and
    development server, that allows you to develop, build and preview richmedia units as fast as possible. This site was
    created to be a step-by-step guide for getting started using the temple server, as well as developing, building and
    previewing you advertising display banners.
